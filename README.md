## Dixie Fire Burn Severity And Vegetation Recovery Mapping
This project sought to assess post-fire damage and monitor vegetation recovery following the 2021 Dixie Fire in Northern California. The objectives were to:
1. Map burned area and severity using spectral indices like Normalized Burn Ration (NBR) and difference NBR.
2. Monitor seasonal vegetation recovery using spectral indices like Normalized Vegetation Difference Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI).
3. Monitor changes in land cover.
